We've been busy backstage, preparing Orlo for some exciting things coming your way. Think of it as renovating the foundation while you're comfortably using the house above.

We've strengthened our security measures, tidied up the code architecture, and set up the groundwork for multiple AI helpers to join the party soon. Plus, we organized our digital filing cabinets and probably rearranged some virtual furniture while we were at it.

Everything should feel just as smooth as before, but now it's built on an even stronger foundation.
