Your daily reflection just got smarter! 

We've enhanced the reflection feature with intelligent question generation that adapts to your unique day.

Day Close is now more flexible - you can navigate back to previous steps if you want to revisit something. Plus, we polished up the calendar with subtle hover effects and obsessively fine-tuned how layers stack up (because apparently we have strong opinions about invisible things).
