Meet Orlo's brand new AI Memory System! 

Your AI assistant now remembers your habits, preferences, and patterns to create truly personalized daily plans. It learns from your behavior and adapts its suggestions over time - think of it as having a personal assistant who actually pays attention.

AI Plan Preview got a major makeover with mobile-friendly controls and smoother interactions. Now you can preview, adjust, and fine-tune your AI-generated plans with ease, whether you're on desktop or mobile.

We also polished up some interface details and probably fed a digital cat while fine-tuning the memory system.
