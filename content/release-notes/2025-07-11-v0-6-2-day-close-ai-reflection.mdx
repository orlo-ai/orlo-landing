Meet your new reflection companion! Day Close now features an AI-powered reflection feedback system that responds to your daily thoughts with personalized insights, gentle encouragement, and sometimes a sprinkle of wisdom from across cultures and history.

Whether you're celebrating wins, processing challenges, or just reflecting on the ordinary moments, your AI companion offers thoughtful responses that feel more like chatting with a wise friend than filling out a form. It draws from diverse perspectives and traditions to offer fresh insights that might just surprise you.

We've also made your Day Close sessions more reliable with better state management - no more losing your thoughts mid-reflection. Plus, we've polished up the user flow so transitioning between daily review and reflection feels seamless.

Behind the scenes, we've been busy automating our version management (because apparently we enjoy making invisible things work better) and cleaned up some chatty debug logs that were cluttering up the console.
