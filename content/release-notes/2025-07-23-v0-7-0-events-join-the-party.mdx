Say hello to Events - your calendar's new unmovable companions! While your TimeBoxes have always been the flexible friends you can shuffle around whenever inspiration strikes, Events are the reliable ones who show up exactly when they're supposed to. Think meetings, classes, appointments, birthdays, and that important presentation you definitely can't reschedule because your boss is expecting it.

Your AI assistant now understands the difference between "I can move my reading time" and "I absolutely cannot move this client meeting." This means smarter scheduling suggestions, better conflict detection, and no more AI recommendations to squeeze in a workout session right when you're supposed to be in that all-hands meeting.

We've unified the entire calendar system so both TimeBoxes and Events play nicely together. Your AI now knows what's movable and what's not, making it way better at helping you plan realistic days that actually work with your real-world commitments.

Behind the scenes, we've also streamlined time handling across the entire app (because apparently we have strong opinions about how time should work), polished up modal dialogs, and spent way too much time debating the perfect shade of blue while making everything more reliable.

The Day Close feature now handles both types of schedule items, so your evening reflection captures the full picture of your day - both the flexible stuff you chose to do and the fixed commitments you had to honor.
