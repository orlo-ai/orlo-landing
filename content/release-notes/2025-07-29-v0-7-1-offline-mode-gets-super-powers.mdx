Your Orlo just became your most reliable companion, even when the internet decides to ghost you! We've completely rebuilt the offline experience so you can keep planning and staying productive in airplane mode, spotty coffee shops, or that corner where WiFi goes to die.

No more frustrating "No internet" errors when you refresh - everything just works, seamlessly switching between online and offline modes. We also made login sessions more persistent, so connection hiccups won't mysteriously log you out.

Behind the scenes, we cleaned up some chatty debug messages, reorganized our digital filing cabinets, and probably taught a robot how to make better coffee while perfecting the offline experience.
