Your voice matters, and now we've built the perfect stage for it! We've rolled out a brand new feedback system that gives you a proper home for all your brilliant ideas, bug reports, and "what if we could..." suggestions. Found something wonky? Have a game-changing feature idea? There's finally a dedicated place for all of it.

Behind the scenes, we've been playing notification whisperer - they now appear in friendlier spots and behave more reliably. Plus, we squashed some timer quirks that were probably making you question if time itself was broken.

Small improvements, big difference. Your feedback shapes everything we build, so now you have the tools to make it count even more.
