Your Day Close reflection just became a much better listener! We've transformed how your AI companion responds to your daily thoughts, shifting from quick conversational replies to thoughtful, detailed feedback. Your reflection sessions now get richer, more comprehensive responses that give you more to work with.

We've also made the whole experience more reliable - no more losing your thoughts mid-reflection or running into errors. Behind the scenes, we streamlined our systems and probably rearranged some virtual furniture while making everything more stable.

Your daily reflection deserves thoughtful responses, and now it gets them.
