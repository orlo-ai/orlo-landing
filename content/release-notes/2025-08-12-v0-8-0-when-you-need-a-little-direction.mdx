Those moments between scheduled items when you're not sure what to do next? We've built something for that. Ask for suggestions, and ORLO instantly offers personalized options that fit your available time.

This isn't just about squeezing in more tasks. ORLO balances what you need right now â€“ whether that's tackling important work, taking a refreshing walk, calling a friend, or handling life's everyday maintenance. It reads the room: Monday morning suggestions hit different than Friday afternoon ones. Just finished something intense? Here's something lighter. Every suggestion is thoughtfully timed and contextually aware.

No more decision fatigue in those precious gaps. We've fine-tuned the balance between getting things done and taking care of yourself, turning dead time into exactly what you need it to be.
