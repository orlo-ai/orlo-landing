Your daily command center just got a major redesign! The Today page now features a cleaner, more focused interface with a soothing blue theme that's easier on the eyes. We've added Quick Capture right where you need it, streamlined the Up Next section, and simplified the overall layout to help you focus on what matters most.

We've also enhanced your Calendar experience with swipe navigation – now you can swipe left and right through your three-day view like flipping through pages. Plus, we've improved how all-day events display and made everything feel smoother.

Behind the scenes, we unified the color scheme, removed those pesky scrollbars cluttering up the view, and probably taught a robot to make better coffee while perfecting the mobile experience.

Your daily planning companion just got more beautiful and focused. Same Orlo wisdom, now with a calmer, more intuitive interface!
