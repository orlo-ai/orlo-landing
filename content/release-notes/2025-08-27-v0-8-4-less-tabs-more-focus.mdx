Following the Today page makeover, we've simplified Tasks and Captures too! Your Tasks page now has just two tabs – Open and Close – because that's really all that matters, right?

We've also made your Captures stay in a consistent "newest first" order, so you won't lose track of what you just added. Plus, we've cleaned up the interface with unified layouts and softer colors throughout.

Behind the scenes, we optimized performance and probably taught a digital cat some new tricks while making everything more reliable.
