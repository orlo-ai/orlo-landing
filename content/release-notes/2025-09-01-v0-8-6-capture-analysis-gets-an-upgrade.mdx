Remember how you could turn a capture into a task? Well, now it's way smarter. Our upgraded AI can break down your longer captures into multiple actionable tasks. Whether it's voice notes, meeting thoughts, or that brain dump you did at 2 AM, it all gets the smart treatment.

Hit "Convert Tasks" and watch as our AI reads through everything and suggests several relevant, categorized tasks from a single capture. Sort through the suggestions, pick what makes sense, and convert them all at once. Perfect for those rambling voice memos where you jump between work stuff and personal reminders, or that stream-of-consciousness note that somehow covers both your project deadline and weekend grocery list.

Behind the scenes, we fixed dropdown positioning issues, optimized database performance for faster loading, and probably taught a digital hamster some new tricks while making everything more stable and responsive.
