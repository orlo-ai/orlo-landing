            <p>This is the Privacy Policy of the Orlo website and any affiliated software and mobile applications (collectively, the "Site"), operated by Orlo (together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, "Orlo", "we", "us", "our" and terms of similar meaning) and our related products and services (collectively, the "Service" or "Services"). It describes the information that we collect from you as part of the normal operation of our Site, and how we use and disclose this information.</p>
            
            <p>By accepting the Privacy Policy in the registration process or by visiting and using the Site or the Services, you expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service.</p>

            <h2>1. The Information We Collect And Store</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Information You Provide.</strong> When you register an Account, we may collect personal information, such as your name, email address, and payment information. The Site allows you to link your Third Party Accounts. We may use OAuth, if available, to access Third Party Accounts in order to limit our collection of your passwords. For a Third Party Account that does not support OAuth, we will ask for your login credentials for such Third Party Account. We may access and collect information that your privacy settings on the Third Party Account permit us to access, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Log Data.</strong> When you use the Service, we may automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, and other interactions with the Service.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies.</strong> We use cookies and similar technologies to collect information, provide a better user experience, and improve our Services. You can instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies, but this may limit your ability to use all aspects of the Service.</p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Personal Information</h2>
            
            <p>Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, including providing AI-powered suggestions, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Analytics.</strong> We collect some information using logging and cookies, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service's technical administration, and to increase our Service's functionality and user-friendliness.</p>

            <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Your Use.</strong> We are designed as a personal time management tool. Your information is private to your Account.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service. These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Third Party Applications.</strong> We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Compliance with Laws.</strong> We may disclose information when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Orlo or its users; or (d) to protect Orlo's property rights.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information.</strong> We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service.</p>

            <h2>4. Changing or Deleting Your Information</h2>
            
            <p>You can access and modify the Personal Information associated with your Account by contacting us at hello@orlo.cc. If you want us to delete your Personal Information and your Account, please contact us with your request. We will take steps to delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by law.</p>

            <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
            
            <p>We will retain your information for as long as your Account is active or as needed to provide you the Services. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

            <h2>6. Security</h2>
            
            <p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

            <h2>7. Our Policy Toward Children</h2>
            
            <p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 16. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 16. If we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with Personal Information, we will take steps to delete such information from our files.</p>

            <h2>8. Contacting Us</h2>
            
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@orlo.cc" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">hello@orlo.cc</a>.</p>

            <h2>9. Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2>
            
            <p>This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, and the most current version will be posted on our Site. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
